**Project Introduction:**

CuteSqlite is the graphical user interface(GUI) tool for SQLite3. And it is an open-source software.
It allows you to design,create and browse you database,work in database objects, and insert data as well as design and run SQL queries to work with stored data.
You can also migrate database and data from other database vendors to your SQLite3 database. 

It is implemented using C++/WTL and supports Windows operating systems.


**Project Objectives:**

The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight, high-performance, and feature-rich SQLite client.

**Development Environment:**

1. Windows 10 or later with the Windows 10 SDK
2. Visual Studio 2017 (v14.1) or later with C++ 11 support
3. Windows Template Library (WTL) version 10.0.10320 Release (2020-11-15)
4. Uses third-party projects: curl, rapidjson, Scintilla, spdlog, and SQLite3

**Advantages:**
**1. Complete functionality:** The goal is to make the best SQLite client.
**2. Small size:** The application compressed package is only 6MB.
**3. Excellent performance:** Developed with C++11/WTL, it is infinitely close to the performance of the Win32 API.
**4. Small memory footprint:** Only 5-8MB of memory is required.
**5. Advanced features:** SQL analysis and optimization, storage analysis.
